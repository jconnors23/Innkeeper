# Project Intuition:

This bot was created to serve as a tool for users in a Discord server I created. It enables our community to fetch Magic the Gathering cards with ease and helps facilitate conversations concerning the card game. It uses the Scryfall API to fetch cards. Developing Innkeeper contributed to my learning through allowing me to dive into developing with Discord, Typescript, Axios, Github actions, and finally AWS services.

# Technology Descriptions

Discord JS: Developed using the Discord library to allow the bot to be integrated through Discord.

Typescript: Developed entirely in Typescript to allow for ease of understanding and clarity.

Axios: Get requests for fetching cards.

Github Actions: Github action allows the bot to be automatically deployed to AWS Services for hosting purposes.

AWS Services: AWS Lightsail for 24/7 hosting purposes.
